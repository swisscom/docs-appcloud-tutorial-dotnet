In this step you will deploy the app to <%= vars.product_full %>.

Push your app to the cloud by executing the following command and replacing the "my-random-hostname" with your own hostname. This will be part of the URL your app will be reached at and it has to be globally unique so be creative. The `-m 64M` tells Cloud Foundry to use 64MB of memory for our app which should be plenty. The `-b` tells Cloud Foundry to use the .NET Core buildpack.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-dotnetcore-app -m 64M -n my-random-hostname -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dotnet-core-buildpack.git

</pre>

The application is now deployed. Ensure that the app is running:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf app my-dotnetcore-app

OK

</pre>

Now visit the app at the URL. You can find the URL in the `urls` property of the statement above.
