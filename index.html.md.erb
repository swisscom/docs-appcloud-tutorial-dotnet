<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This tutorial will help you to deploy a .NET Core app in minutes.

Hang on for a few more minutes to learn how it all works, so you can make the most out of <%= vars.product_full %>.

The tutorial assumes that you have an <%= vars.product_short %> account, and that you have <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core" target="_blank">.NET Core</a> installed locally.

Furthermore, you must have a first Cloud Foundry <a href="../concepts/roles.html#orgs" target="_blank">Organization</a> and <a href="../concepts/roles.html#spaces" target="_blank">Space</a> to push your apps to. In case you don't have that yet, please follow the tutorials in the web console before returning here.
