In this step, you will prepare a simple application that can be deployed.
Execute the following commands to clone the sample application:

<pre class="terminal">
$ git clone https://github.com/swisscom/cf-sample-app-dotnet.git
$ cd cf-sample-app-dotnet
</pre>

You now have a functioning git repository that contains a simple <a href="https://www.asp.net/" target="_blank">ASP.NET Core</a> application as well as a `project.json` file, which is used by .NET's dependency manager.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>: In case you are stuck during the tutorial, you can always check out the [`final-result`](https://github.com/swisscom/cf-sample-app-dotnet/tree/final-result) branch of the sample app repo to see what your code should look like.
